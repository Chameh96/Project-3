      "We've created our ultimate recipe for crispy, crunchy roast potatoes – follow our cookery team's top tips to take this classic side dish from standard to sensational",
    method: [
      'A day or two before roasting, prepare the potatoes. You need chunks or whole potatoes roughly the size of a clementine, so peel and leave whole, halve or quarter accordingly. Place the potatoes in a large pan of cold, salted water – salting is important, so don’t skip it. Bring the water to the boil and simmer gently for about 15 mins until the potatoes are cooked all the way through but not on the brink of collapse. Gently drain the potatoes in a colander, but do not shake them or ruffle them up – just leave them to drain and cool. Once there is no more steam coming off them, place on a tray in a single layer and put them in the fridge, uncovered, until ready to roast',
      'Heat oven to 200C/180C/gas 6 (or put them in when you turn it up for the turkey). Pour oil into a deep roasting tin to give an even layer of about 0.5cm. Place the tin in the oven for 5 mins to heat the oil, then remove from the oven. One at a time and working methodically (starting at one corner of the roasting tin and lining them up as you go) place each potato in the oil and use a spoon to turn it so it’s completely coated. Don’t worry about the oil cooling down too much. Once all the potatoes are in the tin in a single layer, not touching, place the tin in the oven and cook for 40 mins, undisturbed.',
      'Remove from the oven and – again, meticulously – turn each potato. Return to the oven for 20 mins, then repeat the potato-turning process again. If, at this stage, your other side dishes allow you to, turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and give the potatoes a final 20 mins. By now you should have potatoes that are everything a roastie should be: deep, golden and crunchy on the outside with an extra-fluffy middle – just sprinkle with a little sea salt to serve.'

      'This amazing homemade chicken pie is the perfect sharing dish. Beautiful crumbly pastry, tender pieces of chicken and sweet leeks cooked in a creamy cider sauce. What are you waiting for? Get stuck in.',
    method: [
      'Use a large sharp knife to carefully cut down the back bone of the chicken, cutting it in half. Season with sea salt and black pepper.',
      'Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and sear for 10 minutes, or until golden. Reserve the pan for the cabbage.',
      'Meanwhile, chop the pancetta into 1cm chunks, pick in the thyme leaves and place in a large shallow casserole pan with 1 teaspoon of oil. Put it on a medium heat so the fat renders out, while you wash and trim the white part of the leek (save the green for making soup) and the celery. Peel the onion and carrot, then roughly chop all the veg into 1.5cm chunks and add to the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened.',
      'Stir in 2 heaped tablespoons of flour, cook for 2 minutes, then pour in the cider. Let it bubble away for 2 minutes or until almost evaporated, then stir in the mustard and stock. Add the chicken breast-side down, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook on a low heat for 1 hour, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.',
      'Meanwhile, for the pastry, put the flour in a bowl with a good pinch of salt. Grate in the cold butter, then rub with your fingers until it resembles breadcrumbs. Pour in 100ml of cold water, mix with a fork, then bring together with your hands until it forms a dough, adding an extra splash of water if needed. Divide into 2 pieces – you will need ⅓ for the lid and ⅔ for the base – flatten with your hands and chill until needed.',
      'Finely slice the mushrooms and set aside.',
      'Transfer the chicken to a plate and shred the meat (discard the carcass).',
      'Stir the mushrooms into the pan, followed by the shredded chicken and the crème fraîche, mix well and season to taste.',
      'Strain the chicken mixture through a sieve over a clean pan to catch the liquid, gently pressing to help it along, and reserve for your gravy. Leave to cool.',
      'Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5.',
      'Lightly grease a 30cm pie dish with oil. Roll out the larger piece of pastry between 2 sheets of greaseproof paper to just a few millimetres thick and use it to line the dish – allow an overhang. Press firmly into the edges and up the sides of the dish.',
      'Fill with the cooled chicken mixture, then carefully roll out and top with the remaining piece of pastry. Beat the egg and brush a little over the edge of the lid then fold over the overhang and press down gently to seal. Egg wash the pie all over, then make a small incision in the centre to let the steam escape and bake at the bottom of the oven for 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden and the pie is piping hot.',
      'Click off and discard any tatty outer leaves from the cabbage, then cut in half. Halve the core, then finely slice. Roughly chop the rest into large chunks. Place the chicken pan on a high heat, add the cabbage stalks and fry for 2 minutes, then go in with the leaves and a splash of water and cook for 5 minutes more, or until softened and lightly charred. Stir in the mustard, then add a pinch of salt and white pepper with a splash of water, and simmer for 1 minute, tossing a few times.',

    method: [
      'Put the dried porcini mushrooms in a heatproof measuring jug and pour over freshly boiled water until it reaches the 250ml / 1 cup mark. Poke the mushrooms down a bit with a spoon (they will bob straight back up, though!) then cover the jug with a small plate and leave for half an hour, while you get on with the onions.',
      'Roughly chop the onions. Warm the first 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy based pan or casserole, no smaller than 22cm / 9 inches in diameter, and that comes with a very tightly fitting lid. Stir in the onions, sprinkle in 1 teaspoon sea salt flakes (or ½ teaspoon fine sea salt), and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, keeping a close eye on them, then turn down the heat to low and let them cook gently – giving them a stir every now and again – for a further 20-25 minutes, until they are soft and golden, but don’t let them burn.',
      'While the onions are cooking gently, cut your aubergine into 1 cm / ½ inch dice. If you think the carrots need peeling, peel them, but if they are tender-skinned I don’t bother. Grate them and set them aside for now. Trim the parsley stalks to remove the very ends, and then finely chop enough stalks to give you 4 x 15ml tablespoons (about an espresso cup’s worth) / ¼ cup. Put the leaves back in the fridge for now.',
      'When the onions are ready, turn the heat to high, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and tumble in the aubergine cubes, and stir them about in the hot pan for 5 minutes, though if you need to turn the heat down to medium, do.',
      'Take the pan off the heat. Strain the soaked dry mushrooms, reserving the precious umami-water. Chop the mushrooms finely and scrape into the pan. Grate or mince over the garlic, sprinkle in the chilli flakes, dried thyme and sweet smoked paprika, followed by the chopped parsley stalks. Put the pan back on the hob and cook, stirring, over medium heat for a minute. If you feel you need any more oil, just add it, but it doesn’t matter if the pan is pretty dry; you just don’t want anything to burn and stick.',
      'Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons sea salt flakes (or 1 teaspoon fine sea salt) followed by the 2 tablespoons of tomato puree and cook, stirring, over medium-low heat for a further 3 minutes.',
      'Stir in the reserved grated carrots. Add the red, green and puy lentils, followed by the 2 tins of tomatoes. Divide the cold water between the two empty tins and swill out into the pan, and then add the reserved mushroom-soaking water. Give everything a good stir, then bring to a bubble, then clamp on the lid, turn down the heat to low let everything simmer gently for a good hour. You want everything to be soft, and condensed stickily, though by all means do check regularly to make sure your mess of pottage is neither too dry nor burning, adding water as necessary. But don’t make this too liquid, as you will be adding pasta cooking water later. Once the lentils are ready, finely chop enough parsley leaves to give you enough to come up to the 250ml mark on a measuring jug/ 1 cup, and stir this into the hot pan. Whatever is left on the chopping board you can sprinkle over later. And once this is done, you can take the pan off the heat, and leave it with the lid on to keep warm for 30 or so minutes if wished. There are notes in the recipe intro as to how much sauce you might need for how much pasta.',
      'Towards the end of the sauce’s cooking time or while it’s being kept warm – whatever suits you more – put water on to boil for the spaghetti. When the water’s come to the boil, salt it, but not too exuberantly and add the amount of pasta you need.',
      'When the spaghetti’s cooked, use a pasta fork to add it to the sauce, along with as much of the pasta cooking water as you need to help bind the sauce to the spaghetti. Or you can dip in a measuring jug to remove about 500ml / 2 cups of the pasta water, and then drain the spaghetti in a colander. Sprinkle each bowl with a little parsley.'
